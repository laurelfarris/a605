\section{Introduction}
Discuss general viewpoint: What can happen to an atom or molecule or dust
grain sitting in the ISM?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can it absorb a photon? Energy levels $\leftrightarrow$ $h\nu$
        (Need cross-sections for dust grains)
    \item Can it collide with other particles? $\rightarrow$ collisional
        rates [s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$]
    \item Is there a magnetic field? Is the particle charged?
    \item Are there cosmic rays? These can penetrate dense gas.
\end{itemize}
Three possible sources of ionization (and excitation):
\begin{tasks}(3)
\task photons
\task collisions
\task cosmic rays
\end{tasks}
Typical collisional energies: kinetic energy.
Translate $mv^{2} \rightarrow kT \rightarrow h\nu \rightarrow eV$.

\paragraph{Dust grains}\marginpar{-8-} also occur in the neutral medium, and
probably also in the (warm) ionized medium. Dust grains play an important
role in various processes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item extinction of starlight
    \item emission of absorbed energy in FIR
    \item formation of molecules often occurs on grain surfaces
    \item absorption of ionizing UV radiation and Ly$\alpha$ photons
        (reducing amount of ionizing radiation)
    \item heating of HI gas by \emph{photoelectric} emission
\end{itemize}
Composition: carbon and silicates. Typical sizes: 0.01 - 0.1 $\mu$m
(How do we know? $\rightarrow$ shape of extinction curve). Grains as small
as $\sim$ 60 atoms across discovered; evidence from emission lines in NIR
and excess emission at 5 - 40 $\mu$m over what is expected from dust in the ISM\@.
The larger dust grains have temperatures between 10 and 40 K, while the small
ones can be heated to higher temps due to the absorption of even a single
photon (smaller heat capacity, as volume $\propto r^{3}$). A promising
candidate for small dust grains: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
($\sim$ car soot!)

In hot environments, dust grains may be destroyed by \textit{sputtering},
where collisiosn of grains with other atoms, electrons, or molecules
knock molecules off the grains. \marginpar{-9-}At low temperatures,
molecules stick to dust grains, causing depletion of heavy elements
along certain lines of sight (most dust in the plane).
Dust contributes about 1\% of the mass of the ISM in the solar
neighborhood, mostly in the form of large grains.

\paragraph{Ionized gas}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item Photoionization: especially effective near hot stars. Shock
        ionization
    \item Cosmic rays: can occur throughout most of the ISM, so can also
        produce a small amount of ionization in denser gas (though
        recombination happens quickly, so not much of gas is in an
        ionized state at any given time).
    \item Collisions\marginpar{-11-} Hot ($\sim 10^{7}$ K) expanding bubble
        sweeps up shell of warm ($\sim 10^{4}$ K) ionized gas, which shows
        a different optical spectrum than HII regions. The hot gas shows
        up by:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Free-free and line x-rays
            \item absorption lines of highly ionized species toward
                bright UV sources
        \end{itemize}
        Kirchoff's law: apparently can still see absorption lines when looking
        through a gas that is hotter than the source behind it!
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Magnetic fields and cosmic rays}\marginpar{-13-}
In the solar neighborhood, $\mathbf{B} \sim 2-5\times10^{6}$ Gauss.
This follows from measurements of \textit{Faraday rotation}, giving
$<n_{e}B_{||}>$ toward pulsars and radio sources. The random component of
the $B$ field is probably as large as the uniform component. In clouds,
the $B$ field can be much higher, $\sim 70 \mu$G (from Zeeman effect splitting
measurements).

The magnetic field is important for several reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It aligns elongated grains, giving rise to polarization
        of starlight
    \item Causes relativisitic electrons to emit synchrotron radiation,
        and most likely plays a role in accelerating electrons to
        relativistic velocities (``magnetic bottle'', Fermi acceleration).
    \item Provides pressure support against gravitational collapse of matter
        since it is frozen into the matter due to ionization heavy elements.
        It also seems to play animportant role in solving the angular momentum
        problem in star formation.\marginpar{Shu et al.}
\end{enumerate}

Total energy density of cosmic rays in solar neighborhood:
$U_{R} \sim 1.3\times10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-3}$.
Why are cosmic rays important?\marginpar{-14-}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They produce $\gamma$-rays through collisions with atoms and
        molecules. The observed $\gamma$-ray intensity from the ISM forms
        an excellent independent measure of the total amount of matter
        between stars. For example, calibrating the conversion factor of
        CO line intensity to H$_{2}$ mass.
    \item Provide pressure against gravitational collapse
\end{itemize}
Five pressures that play an important role in supporting the ISM against
gravitational collapse:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item thermal $P=nkT$
    \item magnetic $P=\cfrac{B^{2}}{8\pi}$
    \item turbulent (bulk motion)*
    \item cosmic ray
    \item radiation
\end{enumerate}
* The cloud to cloud velocity dispersion due to turbulence on various
scales increases line widths [over?] thermal widths. From the table
on page -12-, you will note rough thermal pressure euqilibrium between
the components. This is not a coincidence; in fact, some of this
information was inferred by assuming pressure equilibrium. The
argument is that if there were no equilibrium, the resulting
perturbations would be wiped out on sound-crossing time scales, which
are short compared to\marginpar{-15-} the time scales we wouuld
consider the ISM to evolve over.

However, the actual evidence for equilibrium in the thermal pressure
is scarse, and there are claims that it is not true in the very local
ISM\footnote{\href{http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v375/n6528/abs/375212a0.html}
{Bowyer et al. \textit{Nature} 1905}}.

There seems to be a ``cosmic conspiracy'': the estimates for the
thermal, magnetic, and cosmic ray pressure for the solar neighborhood
give roughly equal numbers for all three. Thus it may be inappropriate
to only consider the thermal pressure (the only one that can be
measured with much certainty). Interestingly, the magnetic pressure
number is also very similar to the energy density of the CMB\@.
\footnote{Draine discusses possible reasons in section 1.3}
\footnote{Supplemental info in Draine chapter 1.}

Next\marginpar{-16-} section is sort of a shortened condensation of Draine's chapters
2 and 3. We may come back to specific topics discussed there in more
detail.
\section{Validity of the laws of statistical physics in ISM conditions}
Four major laws of statistical physics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Maxwellian} velocity distribution
    \item \textbf{Boltzmann distribution} of energy levels in atoms and molecules
    \item \textbf{Saha equation} for ionization equilibrium
    \item \textbf{Planck function} for radiation
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Maxwellian} $T$ is defined by motion of particles.
($\vec{\omega}$ = velocity = $\vec{v}$ in Draine).
$f(\vec{\omega})\mathrm{d}\vec{\omega}$ = fractional number of
particles whose velocity lies within the three-dimensional volume element
$\mathrm{d}\vec{\omega} =
\mathrm{d}\omega_{x}\mathrm{d}\omega_{y}\mathrm{d}\omega_{z}$,
centered at velocity $\vec{\omega}$.

In thermodynamic equilibrium, $f(\vec{\omega})$ is isotropic, so
$\vec{\omega} \rightarrow \omega$.
$${ f(\omega) =
    \frac{\ell^{3/2}}{\pi^{3/2}}\exp(-\ell^{2}\omega^{2});\quad
    \ell^{2} = \frac{m}{2kT} = \frac{3}{2<\omega^{2}>}
}$$ $${
    f(\omega) = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi kT}\right)^{3/2}
    \exp\left(-\frac{m\omega^{2}}{2kT}\right)
}$$
For two groups of particles with different masses, we replace $\omega$
by $u$, the relative velocity between the two groups, and $m$ by the
reduced mass $m_{r} = \cfrac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$.
For\marginpar{-17-} H atoms colliding with particles of mass $Am_{H}$,
Spitzer derives:$${
    <u> = \left[\frac{8kT}{\pi m_{r}}\right]^{1/2}
    = 1.46\times10^{4}\sqrt{T}\left(1+\frac{1}{A}\right)^{1/2}\;
    [\mathrm{cm\; s}^{-1}]
}$$
\ldots Speed vs.\ velocity

The Maxwell velocity distribution is characterized by several speeds:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1ex]
    \item Most probable speed: $\omega_{o} = \sqrt{\cfrac{2kT}{m}}$
    \item RMS speed: $<\omega^{2}>^{1/2} = \sqrt{\cfrac{3kT}{m}}$
    \item RMS velocity in one direction:
        $<\omega_{x}^{2}>^{1/2} = \sqrt{\cfrac{kT}{m}}$
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Boltzmann distribution}
gives the
\marginpar{-18-}
population of energy levels in an atom or molecule:$${
    \frac{n_{u}}{n_{l}} =
    \frac{g_{u}}{g_{l}}\exp\left[-\left(E_{u}-E_{l}\right)/kT\right]
}$$
where $n_{u,l}$ are the number densities, $g_{u,l}$ are the
statistical weights, and $E_{u,l}$ are the energies of the levels.
(Partition function: summing over all energy levels\ldots chemical
term).

\paragraph{Saha equation} describes ionization equilibrium:$${
    \frac{n_{i+1}}{n_{i}} = \frac{g_{i+1}g_{e}}{g_{i}}
    \left(\frac{2\pi m_{e}kT}{h^{2}}\right)^{3/2}
    \exp\left(-I/kt\right)
}$$
where $I$ is the ionization potential for an ion in the ground state
and initial ionization state $i$ (aka, the energy required to ionize
from $i$ to $i+1$). $g_{e} = 2$ (two spin conditions). Electrons
affect whether and how easily atoms can be ionized.

\paragraph{Plank function} specifies the radiation field:
\footnote{
    $e^{x} \approx 1+x$ for $x<<1$\\
    $e^{h\nu/kT}-1 \approx 1$ for $h\nu<<kT$\\
    $e^{h\nu/kT}-1 \approx e^{h\nu/kT}$ for $h\nu>>kT$}
\begin{align*}
    B(\nu) &= \;\frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}}\frac{1}{\exp[h\nu/kT]-1}\\
    &= \;\sim \frac{2\nu^{2}}{c^{2}}kT\quad \mathrm{for}\;h\nu<<kT\;
    (\mathrm{Rayleigh-Jeans})\\
    &= \;\sim \frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}}\exp[-h\nu/kT]\quad\mathrm{for}\;h\nu>>kT
    (\mathrm{Wien})
\end{align*}

\section{Statistical equilibrium}
\textcolor{bred}{The\marginpar{-19-} four laws discussed above hold under
thermodynamic equilibrium (TE).}
However, this is not often the case for the ISM\@.
Thermodynamic equilibrium requires \textbf{detailed balancing},
i.e.\ each process is as likely to occur as its inverse.
\underline{Example}: Consider the 3727 \AA{} emission from O$^{+}$. This is
a forbidden transition (actually a doublet). The excitation of the electron
level occurs through collisions with electrons, in most conditions in the
ISM\@. If detailed balancing were to hold, de-excitation should also occur
by collisions. However, as we will see, under the low density conditions
found in the ISM, collisions are rare, and de-excitation is more likely to
proceed through emission of a photon, in spite of the fact that we are
dealing with a forbidden transition. Thus [OII] emission can be quite strong,
and by converting collisional (kinetic) energy into radiation, we actually have
created a cooling mechanism for the gas.

Another reason why TE does not hold is the strong \textbf{dilution} of
the radiation field: the concept of a dilute radiation field is quite familiar.
For example, the sun's photosphere is $\sim$ 6000 K, and at the surface the
flux leaving the sun is approximately that of a blackbody of this temperature.
However, the Earth is not 6000 K because by the time the radiation reaches us,
it is diluted. \textcolor{bred}{A diluted radiation field is one in which
the energy density does not match the color temperature.}

For \marginpar{-20-}the solar neighborhood, the total energy density of the
radiation field due to all stars in that volume is about 1 eV cm$^{-3}$
(close to cosmic ray density, as mentioned before). When interpreted as an
average temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law (energy density of a
blackbody, u = aT$^{4}$), this energy density implies an equivalent temperature
of $\sim$ 3 K. Yet the color temperature implied by the shape of the spectrum
of this Interstellar Radiation Field (ISRF) is that of A and B stars
(T $\sim$ 10$^{4}$ K). So there is a \textbf{dilution factor} $W$ given by:
$${ W \approx (\frac{3}{10^{4}})^{4} \approx 0.25\times10^{-14}
}$$
We conclude that using the Plank law to describe intensities is not correct.

What about the other laws?

\paragraph{1. Maxwell velocity distribution} Good news! It is generally
valid. Detailed balancing is possible for the elastic collisions that are
generally occurring. Because the maxwellian distribution is a good
description of the motions of the particles, we can define a kinetic
temperature which describes the physical condition of the gas. Often,
for a plasma, the kinetic temperature is equal to the electron temperature:
$T_{ions} = T_{e}$. $T_{ions} \neq T_{e}$ may occur behind shocks.

\paragraph{2. Boltzmann distribution} is rarely correct.\marginpar{-21-}
If excitation and de-excitation occurs by photons, we may still not have a
Boltzmann distribution because the photon distribution is not given by the
Plank function. Often we do not even have detailed balancing.
However, as we will see, sometimes the distribution of excited levels
is not too different from Boltzmann distribution. This happens when collisions
dominate excitation and de-excitation, while radiation is relatively unimportant.

To describe situations close to TE, Spitzer introduced the so-called
b-factors (Draine calls them ``departure coefficients'').
$${ b_{j} \equiv
    \frac{n_{j}(\mathrm{true\; distribution}}{n_{j}(\mathrm{LTE\; distribution})}
}$$
Example: in an HII region, the hightest excited levels of HI have $b_{j} \sim 1$.
Some radiation does escape (producing radio recombination lines) but collisions
dominate the level populations. Since motions of particles \emph{are} described
by a Maxwellian velocity distribution, whenever collisions dominate the level
population they will closely follow a Boltzmann law.

In \marginpar{-22-}general, a Maxwellian velocity distribution tends to set up
a Boltzmann population for energy levels in the atoms/particles \emph{if}
transitions resulting from emission and absorption of photons are relatively
unimportant, and collisional (de-)excitation is dominant.
In the case of the highly excited levels in H mentioned before,
collisions with electrons are dominant.

\paragraph{3. Saha equation} is generally not valid. There is no detailed
balancing, and even though the ionization and recombination processes are
each other's inverse, the ionization process is determined by the photon
field in most cases, while the recombination process is determined by collisions
between A$^{+}$ and e$^{-}$. The collision rate depends on \{$n_{e}, n_{A^{+}}$\}
and $T_{e}$, but the ionization is dependent on $T_{radiation} (\neq T_{e})$.

So in general, assume \textbf{statistical equilibrium}, where there is
a balance between transitions one way and the other way, no matter
what process caused each transition.

In level $i$, we have $n_{i}$ atoms cm$^{-3}$, and
$R_{ij}$ is the rate coefficient such that

$n_{i}R_{ij}$ [s$^{-1}$] = \# transitions from level $i$ to level $j$\\
$R_{ji}n_{j}$ [s$^{-1}$] = \# transitions from level $j$ to level $i$\\

$${ \frac{\mathrm{d}n_{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} =
    \sum_{j}\left(-R_{ij}n_{i} + R_{ji}n_{j}\right);\quad i=1,2,\ldots
}$$
In\marginpar{-23-} statistical equilibrium,
$\cfrac{\mathrm{d}n_{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0$. The rate factor $R_{ij}$
includes \emph{all} possible processes that would take the atom or
molecule from level $i$ to $j$. In the worst case, you would have to
include many processes to calculate the $n_{i}$ values. This requires
knowledge of a lot of physical input parameters, e.g.\ cross sections
for particular processes, collisional rate coefficients
\footnote{Drane section 2.1}, etc.

In other cases, where only one or two processes matter, the situation
can be very simple. We will encounter cases of each.

Before going more into Ch 2 and 3 in Draine, we will first discuss
some basic radiative transfer.\footnote{RL Ch 1, Draine Ch 6, 7}

\subsection{Natural line width}

\textcolor{bred}{Key point: A small Einstein coefficient $A$ results
in a \emph{narrow} line.}

The natural line width of most transitions is quite small, and broadening
due to other effects is more important.
\subsection{Doppler broadening}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thermal velocities
    \item Bulk motion (turbulence)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Collisional broadening}
$\sim$ Pressure broadening, which is not generally important in the ISM because
the density is so low\ldots mostly occurs in stellar atmospheres.
This still produces a Lorenzian profile, but with:
$${
    \phi(\nu) = \frac{4\Gamma^{2}}{16\pi^{2}(v-v_{o})^{2} + \Gamma^{2}}
}$$

\section{Atomic H in the ISM}
\marginpar{-33-\\Draine Ch\\8, 29;\\Ch\\17.1, 17.3}
Wherever HI dominates the ISM, all atoms are found in the \textbf{ground state}
($^{2}$S)(n=1). The next excited level ($^{2}$P) is about 10 eV above the
ground-level. This excitation is very rare and and quickly falls back to
the ground level, so there is no significant population of this level.
For example, consider potential excitation mechanism: collision of H-atom
with cosmic ray particle (lots of energy, probability is once per
10$^{17}$ seconds), ionizes the H-atom. Recombination results in some
atoms winding up in $^{2}$P state. But $A$ coefficient for spontaneous
emission from 2P $\rightarrow$ 2S is 10$^{8}$ s$^{-1}$. Hence, this excitation
process results in ralative population of 2P level of
$10^{-8}/10^{17} = 10^{-25}$!

ISM is too cool for collisions to happen often and cosmic rays are rare.
Possible tracers of HI gas:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 21 cm HI transition (=hyperfine transition) in emission or absorption.
    \item Lyman absorption lines against hot background stars.
\end{enumerate}
Only the $^{2}$S level is populated. HI is hard to find in the ground state;
fine structure $\rightarrow$ different angular momentum.
\marginpar{See Draine Ch 4 (\& 5) on notation of energy levels and
atomic structure.}

\marginpar{-34-}
\subsection{Excitation and radiative transport for the 21-cm line}
Spin of proton and electron:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel (upper energy)
    \item Anti-parallel (lower energy)
\end{itemize}
(Spin is around particle's own axis, not to be confused with angular
momentum). Motions specified by maxwellian velocity distribution, and
collisions dominate the level populations (excite and de-excite).

Energy difference (very small):
\begin{align*}
    h\nu &= 9.4\times10^{-18}\:\mathrm{erg}\\
    \nu &= 1420.4\:\mathrm{MHz}\\
    \lambda &= 21.11\:\mathrm{cm}
\end{align*}

Spontaneous emission probability is \emph{very} small:
$${ A_{kj} = 2.86\times10^{-15}\:\mathrm{sec}^{-1}  }$$
$${ \rightarrow \mathrm{lifetime} = 1.10\times10^{7}\:\mathrm{years} }$$
More frequently, atoms will flip energy states by \emph{collisions}.
These dominate transitions and cause energy levels to flip.\\

\end{center}
As long as $n(H^{o}) > 10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$, $\gamma n_{H} >> A$, so
collisions determine excitation and de-excitation\ldots implies
detailed balancing, so Boltzmann distribution is valid for level
populations.

where $T_{k}$ = kinetic gas temperature.

be neglected, we would obtain

Note: Potential other excitation process of upper level for HI:
HI + Ly$\alpha$ photon $\rightarrow$ n=2 level (2P). 2P level might cascade
down to upper 2S hyperfine level.

In principle, one might selectively populate the upper level with this
so-called photon pumping.\marginpar{D 17.3}
It turns out that, due to thermilization of the photons this anomalous
population of the levels does not generally occur. (Ly$\alpha$ photons
frequently scatter off A-atom again = LTE situation).

Since\marginpar{-37-} the b's are effectively 1, our \textcolor{bred}{main result}
is that$${
}$$

Are the HI levels always populated mainly by collisions? No, if n(H$^{o}$ drops
low enough, and if the HI is warm it doesn't work as well.

The warm HI in our Galaxy has $n_{H}\sim0.4$ cm $^{-3}$ and $T_{k} \approx$ 8000 K.
But $T_{s}$ = spin temperature, of order $T_{k}$/5, if it weren't for
excitation by Ly$\alpha$ photons.

But it is true that the 3K background radiation field does \emph{not}
significantly disturb the equilibrium set up by collisions, as we
discussed above.

If $n_{H}$ drops to very low values, collisional excitation is ineffective.
But even in that case, $T_{s} \approx T_{k}$ because of the above mentioned
Ly$\alpha$ excitation.

In any case, in general we now obtain for the emission coefficient:
$${
}$$
which is independent of T in most circumstances, and for the absorption
coefficient:
$${
}$$
